# How-to Instructions
## Using the application
You can write the post in the top box of the page, and submit with the blue button. The post is limited to 777 characters and you can submit 5 posts a day -- including reposts and quoteposts. Users cannot delete or edit their posts.

## User profiles
In order to access the profile menus, you need to click in the user's portrait to access his/her profile.

## Following users
Inside their profile, you can follow other users by clicking the follow button. You can unfollow them by clicking the unfollow button.

## Switching between the two views
You can switch between the two views (all/following) by clicking the switch button, located below the "write post" input. Users can also type "/all" or "/following" in the URL to switch between the two views.

## Reposting and Quote-posting
Users can click on the buttons located below each post, inside the users' profiles, to repost or quote-post.   
   
The repost action is instant, while when you quote-post, you need to type the message in the input box and click on the blue button to submit.
